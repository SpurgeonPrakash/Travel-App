# Travel App

## Project Objective

The objective is to build a website that allows the user to add future trips.

The user can enter a destination of interest and save his trip. A countdown and a weather forecast are displayed. The user can delete any trip.


## Comments
### Architecture
Added additional folder test/server, since testing server routes doesn't work with jest.

### Webpack
